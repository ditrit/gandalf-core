## BUILD
You need to have installed python3, pip and virtualenv.

### Install python dependencies
#### First step is to create the env folder
```python3 -m virtualenv```
#### Then activate it
On Windows  : ```env\Scripts\activate.bat``` \
On Linux    : ```source env/bin/activate```
#### And finally install the dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` \
*You can do this step without setting up the virtualenv but the dependencies will be installed globally*
